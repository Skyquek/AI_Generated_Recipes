## Motivation for the Project

I've always loved math, ever since I Was four years old. Naturally, I gravitated towards a math heavy education. However, I felt pure math was too abstract, too intangible. I had a creative urge to build something with had a practical use in the real world. To explore the culinary world through a numerical lens. Thanks for taking the time to read my project.
