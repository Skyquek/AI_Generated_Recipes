Deep learning has been used in many application to solve real-world problems. In recent years, it has seen tremendous growth in its popularity and usefulness, due to more powerful computers, larger datasets, and developments in the field of neural networks. Modern techniques have been transformative in the various fields: finance, engineers, chemistry, allowing professionals to push the edge of what is possible. But artificial intelligence evolve beyond a mere scientific tool; it is capable of teaching humans creativity, artistic vision, and adaptive preferences.

Let's explore the culinary world!

## 1. The Data
### 1.1 Scrapping and Webcrawling

### 1.1 Simple Data File
As it turns out, the final CNN had a __validation accuracy of 58%__. This actually makes a lot of sense. Because our expressions usually consist a combination of emotions, and _only_ using one label to represent an expression can be hard. In this case, when the model predicts incorrectly, the correct label is often the __second most likely emotion__ as seen in Figure 8 (examples with light blue labels).
