I have a background in infectious disease epidemiology and when I was in graduate school there was a lot of interest in using things like Google search queries, Facebook posts, and tweets to try to track the spread of infectious diseases in real-time. One of the limitations to using Twitter is that only about 1% of tweets are geotagged with the tweet's location, which can make much of this work very difficult.
