Deep learning has been used in many application to solve real-world problems. In recent years, it has seen tremendous growth in its popularity and usefulness, due to more powerful computers, larger datasets, and developments in the field of neural networks. Modern techniques have been transformative in the various fields: finance, engineers, chemistry, allowing professionals to push the edge of what is possible. But artificial intelligence evolve beyond a mere scientific tool; it is capable of teaching humans creativity, artistic vision, and adaptive preferences.

Let's explore the culinary world!

## 1. The Data

#### 1.1 Scrapping and Webcrawling



#### 1.2 Condensed Data File

Due to the limitations in time and computation cost of scraping websites, let's use a cleaned dataset borrow from Kevin Broh-Kahn's Github repository. [2] This dataset was procured from allrecipes.com, [3] prior to 2017, totalling 18417 observations. It is saved as a json file and reuploaded in the /data directory.
